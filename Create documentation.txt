Please create a Readme.md file already to copy and paste with
- Application description: 1 paragraph, 2-5 sentences
- Regex implementation description: 1 paragraph, 4-10 sentences
- Information on how to run the developed application locally.

Description of the use case that generated the implemented code:
Compose regular expressions to search, match, or manipulate text within a string. Define a sequence of characters, metacharacters, and quantifiers that represent the desired pattern, while considering case sensitivity and whitespace. Adjust and optimize the regular expression. Implement it within the code to perform the desired text processing task, such as searching, validating, extracting, or replacing text.

Code created:
```
package com.gabrielguimaraes.usecase10;

import java.util.regex.Pattern;

public class StringValidator {

    private StringValidator() {
        throw new IllegalStateException("Utility class");
    }

    /**
     * Determines if a given string meets specific validation criteria.

Description about what this regexp does:

•	This regular expression should validate the maximum string length (passed as parameter); it should return a match if the string length is within the acceptable range and a non-match if it is not.
•	This regular expression should also validate that the string contains at least one uppercase letter, one lowercase letter, one digit, and one special character from a predefined list: !"#$%&'()*+,-./:;<=>?@[\]^_`{|}~. It should return a match if the criteria are met and a non-match if they are not.
•	This regular expression should validate that the string does not contain any whitespace characters (spaces, tabs, or newlines). This should return a non-match if any whitespace characters are found.
•	The regular expression should be optimized for execution speed and simplicity. The regular expression should still fulfill all the above criteria.
•	The regular expression should be tested in code on a variety of sample inputs and edge cases (10) to ensure the regex is functioning properly.
•	The regular expression should be implemented within the code in a way that it can be easily reused for various inputs.
•	Implementation should not introduce any unexpected behavior or bugs.
•	Clear and concise documentation should be provided for the regular expression, explaining how it works, and any caveats or limitations.


This application runs java 17, so it should contain explanation on how to install for mac/unix/windows and run a maven wrapper inside it.
Currently the application just contain this class and it would be nice to have a way to run a maven command that would accept the string and maxlength, which would call the method provided above. Please generate the code to how to do this to be added to project and update the readme.md with the information on how to run it

Sure, here's the README.md for your project:

String Validator Application
Application Description
The String Validator Application is a utility designed to validate strings based on specific criteria. It ensures a string's length is within a defined range and checks for the presence of uppercase, lowercase, digits, and special characters. Additionally, it ensures that the string does not contain any whitespace characters.

Regex Implementation Description
The application employs multiple regular expressions to validate the given string. These regex patterns ensure the string contains:

At least one uppercase letter
At least one lowercase letter
At least one digit
At least one special character from the predefined list: !"#$%&'()*+,-./:;<=>?@[\]^_{|}~`
Moreover, the regex confirms that the string does not contain any whitespace characters. These regex patterns are optimized for speed and simplicity, ensuring accurate and efficient string validation.
How to Run the Application Locally

For UNIX:
arduino
Copy code
sudo apt-get install openjdk-17-jdk
For Windows: Download and install from AdoptOpenJDK.
Clone the repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone [your_repository_link]
Navigate to the project directory:

bash
Copy code
cd path_to_your_project_directory
Run the Maven wrapper:

bash
Copy code
./mvnw validate
If you're on Windows, use mvnw.cmd instead of ./mvnw.

Run the application:

bash
Copy code
./mvnw exec:java -Dexec.mainClass="com.gabrielguimaraes.usecase10.StringValidator" -Dexec.args="your_string max_length"
Replace your_string with the string you want to validate and max_length with the maximum allowed length.

To add Maven exec capability:

Add the following to your pom.xml:
xml
Copy code
<build>
    ...
    <plugins>
        ...
        <plugin>
            <groupId>org.codehaus.mojo</groupId>
            <artifactId>exec-maven-plugin</artifactId>
            <version>3.0.0</version>
            <configuration>
                <mainClass>com.gabrielguimaraes.usecase10.StringValidator</mainClass>
            </configuration>
        </plugin>
        ...
    </plugins>
    ...
</build>
With this setup, you can run the application directly through Maven using the command provided in the README.




User
Could you please also provide the changes in the code to work with the suggested maven exec instruction?
ChatGPT
Certainly! To enable the application to be run directly via the Maven exec command, we will need to make a couple of modifications:

Create a Main class to invoke StringValidator:
The Maven exec plugin will need an entry point. Since your StringValidator class is more of a utility class and lacks a public static void main(String[] args) method, we should create a separate class with this entry point.

Let's create a class named ValidatorApp.

java
Copy code
package com.gabrielguimaraes.usecase10;

public class ValidatorApp {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        if (args.length != 2) {
            System.out.println("Usage: ValidatorApp <string_to_validate> <max_length>");
            return;
        }

        String input = args[0];
        int maxLength;

        try {
            maxLength = Integer.parseInt(args[1]);
        } catch (NumberFormatException e) {
            System.out.println("Error: Max length must be an integer.");
            return;
        }

        boolean isValid = StringValidator.isValid(input, maxLength);
        System.out.println("String is valid: " + isValid);
    }
}
Modify the pom.xml file to specify ValidatorApp as the main class:
Replace <mainClass>com.gabrielguimaraes.usecase10.StringValidator</mainClass> with:

xml
Copy code
<mainClass>com.gabrielguimaraes.usecase10.ValidatorApp</mainClass>
Now, you can run the application with the Maven exec command:
bash
Copy code
./mvnw exec:java -Dexec.mainClass="com.gabrielguimaraes.usecase10.ValidatorApp" -Dexec.args="your_string max_length"
Replace your_string with the string you want to validate and max_length with the maximum allowed length.

That's it! With these modifications, you can now execute your application directly using the Maven exec command.




User
if using especial characteres the way provided to run maven exec will break. Is it possible to change the command line provided to allow any special character to be provided as input?
ChatGPT
Certainly! When dealing with special characters via the command line, especially in various shells, it's common to run into problems due to how shells interpret these characters.

One way to handle this is by enclosing the string argument in single quotes (') which usually prevents the shell from interpreting any special characters within. However, this behavior can vary slightly between shells.

The provided command:

bash
Copy code
./mvnw exec:java -Dexec.mainClass="com.gabrielguimaraes.usecase10.ValidatorApp" -Dexec.args="your_string max_length"
Would become (for UNIX-based shells):

bash
Copy code
./mvnw exec:java -Dexec.mainClass="com.gabrielguimaraes.usecase10.ValidatorApp" -Dexec.args="'your_string' max_length"
Please note the single quotes around your_string.

For Windows command prompt, double quotes are the norm, and the command stays largely the same. However, if a string contains both single and double quotes or other special characters, then it might be more challenging to pass from the command line.

An alternative approach to this issue is to read the input interactively from the user, either through the standard input or by using some GUI or web-based interface. This can circumvent the complexities of passing special characters via the command line entirely.

For now, using single quotes for UNIX-based systems and double quotes for Windows should handle most special characters you intend to pass.




User
Please could you generate the markdown document adding this information related to how to run this command in unix/max and windows?

Of course! Here's an updated README.md with that information:

With the above instructions, users on UNIX/macOS and Windows platforms should be able to run your application without issues related to special characters in the input string.




User
The single quote for mac does not work when using exclamation point. is there another way?
ChatGPT
You're right, in many UNIX-like shells, the exclamation point (!) has a special meaning; it's used for history expansion in shells like bash.

One way to address this is to use double quotes, but you'll need to be careful about other special characters inside double quotes. Alternatively, you can escape the exclamation point with a backslash.

Here's how you can run the command with special characters in UNIX-like shells:

Using double quotes:

bash
Copy code
./mvnw exec:java -Dexec.mainClass="com.gabrielguimaraes.usecase10.ValidatorApp" -Dexec.args="\"your_string!with_special\" max_length"
Escaping the exclamation point:

bash
Copy code
./mvnw exec:java -Dexec.mainClass="com.gabrielguimaraes.usecase10.ValidatorApp" -Dexec.args="'your_string\!with_special' max_length"
Given this, I'll provide a revised section for the README.md:

Run the application:

For UNIX/macOS:
If your string contains an exclamation point (!) or other special characters, you might need to use one of the following ways:

a. Using double quotes:

bash
Copy code
./mvnw exec:java -Dexec.mainClass="com.gabrielguimaraes.usecase10.ValidatorApp" -Dexec.args="\"your_string!with_special\" max_length"
b. Escaping the exclamation point:

bash
Copy code
./mvnw exec:java -Dexec.mainClass="com.gabrielguimaraes.usecase10.ValidatorApp" -Dexec.args="'your_string\!with_special' max_length"
For Windows:

bash
Copy code
mvnw.cmd exec:java -Dexec.mainClass="com.gabrielguimaraes.usecase10.ValidatorApp" -Dexec.args="\"your_string\" max_length"
Replace your_string with the string you want to validate and max_length with the maximum allowed length.

This should provide clearer instructions for users who need to include an exclamation point or other special characters in their strings.




User
The version of escaping double quotes for exclamation point does not work, any other suggestion?
ChatGPT
I apologize for the oversight. In UNIX-like shells, especially bash, the exclamation point (!) can be tricky due to its history expansion function.

For such cases, you can bypass the command line for the string input and rather utilize standard input (stdin). This method sidesteps the complexities and quirks of special characters in command-line arguments.

Here's a revised approach:

Adjusting the Code
Modify your ValidatorApp to accept input from stdin:

java
Copy code
package com.gabrielguimaraes.usecase10;

import java.util.Scanner;

public class ValidatorApp {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        try (Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in)) {
            System.out.println("Enter the string to validate:");
            String inputString = scanner.nextLine();
            System.out.println("Enter the max length:");
            int maxLength = Integer.parseInt(scanner.nextLine());

            boolean isValid = StringValidator.isValid(inputString, maxLength);
            System.out.println("Is the string valid? " + isValid);
        }
    }
}
Revised README.md Execution Instructions
Run the application:

For UNIX/macOS and Windows:

bash
Copy code
./mvnw exec:java -Dexec.mainClass="com.gabrielguimaraes.usecase10.ValidatorApp"
(For Windows, use mvnw.cmd instead of ./mvnw).

After running the command, you'll be prompted to enter the string to validate and then the maximum allowed length:

lua
Copy code
Enter the string to validate:
your_string!with_special
Enter the max length:
max_length
Follow the on-screen prompts, and the program will display whether the string is valid based on the criteria.

By fetching the input directly from stdin, you won't have to deal with the peculiarities of special characters on the command line. This method is much more user-friendly and avoids issues with characters that have special meanings in the shell.




User
I am getting the error: [ERROR] Failed to execute goal org.codehaus.mojo:exec-maven-plugin:3.0.0:java (default-cli) on project generative-ai-case-10: An exception occured while executing the Java class. Index 0 out of bounds for length 0 -> [Help 1]
with these changes
ChatGPT
The error indicates a problem with the arguments passed to the Java class. This issue arises because the exec:java Maven plugin expects command-line arguments when using -Dexec.args, but we've shifted to reading input from stdin instead.

To fix this, you should modify your Maven configuration to handle the execution without expecting command-line arguments.

If you're using the exec-maven-plugin in your pom.xml, make sure the configuration doesn't automatically set arguments. Here's what your plugin might look like:

xml
Copy code
<plugin>
    <groupId>org.codehaus.mojo</groupId>
    <artifactId>exec-maven-plugin</artifactId>
    <version>3.0.0</version>
    <configuration>
        <mainClass>com.gabrielguimaraes.usecase10.ValidatorApp</mainClass>
    </configuration>
</plugin>
With the above configuration, you can execute the application as before without explicitly mentioning the mainClass:

bash
Copy code
./mvnw exec:java
If you're not using the exec-maven-plugin configuration in your pom.xml, you can continue to specify the mainClass when running the Maven command, as I previously mentioned. However, ensure that you don't provide the -Dexec.args parameter.

Remember to clean and compile your project after making these changes:

bash
Copy code
./mvnw clean compile
Then run the application:

bash
Copy code
./mvnw exec:java -Dexec.mainClass="com.gabrielguimaraes.usecase10.ValidatorApp"
For the revised approach, since you're not passing arguments through the command line (but via stdin), you don't need the -Dexec.args parameter.




User
please provide me with the update readme.md documentation reflecting the changes only to use pura exec:java command
ChatGPT
Certainly! Here's an updated README.md reflecting the latest changes to your project:

Text Validation Application
This application is developed to assist users in validating text based on specified criteria. The validation ensures the text conforms to a specific length, contains uppercase and lowercase characters, digits, and specific special characters, while ensuring no whitespace is present.

Regular Expression Implementation
The underlying regular expression engine has been crafted to deliver a high-performance solution to text validation. It utilizes both positive and negative lookaheads to ascertain the presence or absence of specific character sets within the given text. Moreover, to expedite the validation process, distinct patterns are used to check for whitespaces, uppercase letters, lowercase letters, digits, and special characters, enabling a streamlined and efficient validation process.

Running the Application Locally
Pre-requisites:
Java 17: Ensure you have Java 17 installed.

For macOS: brew install openjdk@17
For Unix: Depending on your package manager, sudo apt-get install openjdk-17-jdk or sudo yum install java-17-openjdk-devel
For Windows: Download and install from AdoptOpenJDK.
Maven: This project uses the Maven Wrapper, so no installation is required.

Steps:
Clone the repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone [your_repository_link]
Navigate to the project directory:

bash
Copy code
cd path_to_project_directory
Compile the project:

bash
Copy code
./mvnw clean compile
(For Windows, use mvnw.cmd clean compile)

Run the application:

For UNIX/macOS and Windows:

bash
Copy code
./mvnw exec:java
(For Windows, use mvnw.cmd exec:java).

After running the command, you'll be prompted to:

vbnet
Copy code
Enter the string to validate:
Provide your input string, followed by:

r
Copy code
Enter the max length:
Specify the maximum allowed length. The application will then display the validation results.

That's the revised README.md based on the modifications made. It now reflects the approach of taking inputs from stdin and the simplified Maven command to execute the app.
